IMDB clone app provides a user-friendly interface for searching and exploring movie details. It showcases how to interact with a public API (OMDB API), dynamically create and display elements based on user actions, and persist data using the browser's local storage. It serves as a simple example of building a web application using vanilla JavaScript and showcases some essential web development techniques.
The app has the following features:

Home Page: Users can search for movies using a search input field. As they type, the app provides real-time suggestions similar to Google's search suggestions.

Movie Details Page: This page displays detailed information about a selected movie, including its title, poster, IMDb rating, genre, runtime, director, actors, and plot.

My Favorites Page: Users can view a list of their favorite movies on this page. The list is persistent, meaning it remains the same even after closing or refreshing the browser.
